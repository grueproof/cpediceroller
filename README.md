# cpediceroller
A diceroller for D&D  with sound and light effects for the Circuit Playground Express.

## Installation

Copy the code.py and three enclosed .wav files to your Circuit Playground Express.

## How to Use

Button A on the CPE will trigger an d20 roll. Results are displayed as lights: red for tens, green for ones.

On a natural 20, you'll get a fanfare and a rainbow light magical moment. 

On a natural one, you will be ridiculed and the device will light up red. 

Button B will re-initialize the lights for quick re-rolling. 

## Background

I got this cool little device at Pycon 2019, and was itching to do something fun with it. What else is a D&D nerd going to do with it? I ask you...

This was a fun little project. Please feel free to fork and improve it. Or if you are feeling generous, contribute back. 

Thanks,
